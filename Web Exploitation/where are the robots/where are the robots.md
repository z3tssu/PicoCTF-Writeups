## Description

> Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830
## Hints

What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Approach

Downloaded "CookieManger" Firefox Addon.

Since it mentions the robots, it could only mean the robots.txt file
1. Simply add the /robots.txt to the URL and it will provide an extra portion to add to the URL
User-agent: *
Disallow: /1bb4c.html

2. Add it to the original URL and the CTF flag will be provided.

```
